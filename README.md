Data Structures :\n
  A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.\n
  Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.\n
  These datastructures almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures.
  We can define our own data structures in python if we are some what familer with OOPS
  User-Defined Data Structures
      Stack
      Queue
      Trees
      Linked Lists
      Graphs
      HashMaps
  
 Algorithms :
   An algorithm is a step by step process to solve a problem.
   We can solve given problem statement in different ways using different types of algorithms available in computer science
   List of algorithms :
      Brute force algorithms.
      Simple recursive algorithms.
      Backtracking algorithms.
      Divide and conquer algorithms.
      Dynamic programming algorithms.
      Greedy algorithms.
      Branch and bound algorithms.
      Randomized algorithms.
