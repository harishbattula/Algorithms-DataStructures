# Algorithms-DataStructures
## Data Structures :
  ### A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
  Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.
  These datastructures almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures.
  We can define our own data structures in python if we are some what familer with OOPS
  #### User-Defined Data Structures
      1. Stack
      2. Queue
      3. Trees
      4. Linked Lists
      5. Graphs
      6. HashMaps
  
 ## Algorithms :
   ### An algorithm is a step by step process to solve a problem.
   We can solve given problem statement in different ways using different types of algorithms available in computer science
   #### List of algorithms :
      1. Brute force algorithms.
      2. Simple recursive algorithms.
      3. Backtracking algorithms.
      4. Divide and conquer algorithms.
      5. Dynamic programming algorithms.
      6. Greedy algorithms.
      7. Branch and bound algorithms.
      8. Randomized algorithms.
